      <h4>Skills</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            C:Beginner. Don't have a lot of experience aside from uni classes
            and few personal projects.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Python:Begginer+. As can be seen from my github account I really
            like python but I'm not very confident in my skills because of lack
            of real life experience
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Html/Css:I know some basic syntax</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Linux:I've been using linux (Ubuntu and recently switched to Arch
            btw) for about half a year and I have to say I'm very comfortable
          </p>

          <p>
            note:I do not belive this certificate is worth much but if someone
            has it then you can asssume that they have basic understanding of
            html and some knowledge of css. I really didn't like their style of
            projects for this one. Projects not required for certificate were
            actually fine but the ones that are required were really easy and
            not that rewarding experience wise in my opinion.

            note:I enjoyed this one. Projects were comparably as hard as uni
            coding-intro class homework but It's too bad that they didn't give
            bigger projects. Most projects I had to do were max 70 lines of code
            I think.

            note: Really not enjoyable course. Final projects were fine but this
            course took the approach of video learning and I think it failed
            miserably. My main two issues with them are poor explenation and
            lack of information . The person "teaching" this course is looking
            at the documentation half the time and sometimes even gets lost in
            what he's explaining. The lack of information is also big part in
            why I felt this course was so unenjoyable . The person explaining
            does go trough most basic syntax and concepts but not the one's we
            were supposed to use on the projects hence making you do all the
            learning yourself.
