            note:Even tho it's considered as one of the stepping stones into the world of IT and for a good reason I don't think it's any better than an average uni class. The study materials are fine but not great. Test itself is not hard and preparations for the test are not rewarding because you mostly just study for specific questions. Undoubtedly harder than any free course or certificate online but still the knowledge gained isn't enough in my opinion.

            note:I do not belive this certificate is worth much but if someone
            has it then you can asssume that they have basic understanding of
            html and some knowledge of css. I really didn't like their style of
            projects for this one. Projects not required for certificate were
            actually fine but the ones that are required were really easy and
            not that rewarding experience wise in my opinion.

            note:I enjoyed this one. Projects were comparably as hard as uni
            coding-intro class homework but It's too bad that they didn't give
            bigger projects. Most projects I had to do were max 70 lines of code
            I think.

            note: Really not enjoyable course. Final projects were fine but this
            course took the approach of video learning and I think it failed
            miserably. My main two issues with them are poor explenation and
            lack of information . The person "teaching" this course is looking
            at the documentation half the time and sometimes even gets lost in
            what he's explaining. The lack of information is also big part in
            why I felt this course was so unenjoyable . The person explaining
            does go trough most basic syntax and concepts but not the one's we
            were supposed to use on the projects hence making you do all the
            learning yourself.
