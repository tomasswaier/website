      <h4>Skills</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            C:Beginner. Don't have a lot of experience aside from uni classes
            and few personal projects.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Python:Begginer+. As can be seen from my github account I really
            like python but I'm not very confident in my skills because of lack
            of real life experience
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Html/Css:I know some basic syntax</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Linux:I've been using linux (Ubuntu and recently switched to Arch
            btw) for about half a year and I have to say I'm very comfortable
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Certificates</h4>
      <ul>

            class="links"
            href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc6b90c354-b50f-445f-95c7-8ecb4a20215c/responsive-web-design"

          <p>
            note:I do not belive this certificate is worth much but if someone
            has it then you can asssume that they have basic understanding of
            html and some knowledge of css. I really didn't like their style of
            projects for this one. Projects not required for certificate were
            actually fine but the ones that are required were really easy and
            not that rewarding experience wise in my opinion.

            note:I enjoyed this one. Projects were comparably as hard as uni
            coding-intro class homework but It's too bad that they didn't give
            bigger projects. Most projects I had to do were max 70 lines of code
            I think.
